# Discord
A clone of Discord that allows realtime chatting (private/group), video/audio calls and screen sharing.
Also allows creation of groups and inviting friends.

## It's not mobile responsive at all because I am really very busy these days. If anyone willing to contribute on that part, you are more than welcome!

## Installation - Backend (Assuming you are on discord directory.)
```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm ci
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Installation - Frontend (Assuming you are on discord directory.)
```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm ci
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```
